I am passionate about developing highly scalable, resilient applications. I love everything from the Database, Testing, and DevOps to Microservices (Kubernetes, Docker, etc), to the Frontend and Backend. I find it amazing how all pieces work together to provide a fast and pleasurable experience to end-users, mainly because they have no clue how complex that "simple" app is.
