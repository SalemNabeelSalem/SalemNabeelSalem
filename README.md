I am passionate about developing highly scalable, resilient applications. I love everything from the database, testing, DevOps to microservices (Kubernetes, Docker, etc), 
to the frontend. I find amazing to think about how all pieces work together to provide a fast and pleasurable experience to end users, mainly because they have no clue how complex that "simple" app is.

- 🚧 I'm a software developer and devops at **Exatech** in Aden, Yemen.
- 💬 Ask me about **Testing, CI-CD and DevOps**.
